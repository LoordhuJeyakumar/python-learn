## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you will:
- Understand Python data types and variables
- Master control flow and loops
- Write clean, reusable functions
- Work with data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Process files and data persistence
- Understand object-oriented programming basics
- Use regular expressions for text processing
- Manage dates and times
- Configure applications with environment variables
- Build a complete CLI task manager application

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Navigate to the directory**
   ```bash
   cd python-week1-student
   ```
3. **Start with Day 1**
   ```bash
   python week1_cli/variable.py
   ```

## 📝 Tasks & Exercises

Each concept file contains:
- **📖 Explanations** with analogies
- **💻 Code examples** to run
- **✅ Exercises** to complete
- **🎯 Challenges** to solve

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. Check the documentation in `docs/`
2. Review the code examples carefully
3. Ask questions in our communication channel
4. Practice by modifying and experimenting

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You will know you're ready for Week 2 when you can:
- Explain every line of code in your task manager
- Debug errors confidently
- Choose appropriate data structures for problems
- Write clean, documented functions
- Handle files and data persistence
- Build new features independently
