# Variables & Data Types 

# Variables are used to store data values.
# Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.

# example
name = "John"
age = 30
is_active = True

print(name)
print(age)
print(is_active)

# datatypes 
# int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set, None,

# int => Integer (Whole Number)
age = 30
price = 10
distence = 100

# float => Floating Point (Decimal Number)
height = 5.9
weight = 70.5


# str => String (Text)  
name = "John"
address = "123 Main St"
phone = "123-456-7890"


# bool => Boolean (True or False)
is_active = True
is_admin = False
is_logged_in = True 
is_active = None

# list => List (Collection of Items in an ordered sequence )
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
another_list = list()

print(fruits)
print(numbers)
print(another_list)
print(is_active)


# tuple => Tuple (Collection of Items in an ordered sequence ) and it is immutable (Cannot be changed) 
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
another_tuple = tuple()


# dict => Dictionary (Collection of Key-Value Pairs) and it is mutable (Can be changed)  and it is ordered (Maintains the order of insertion)
# key => unique identifier for a value
# value => data associated with a key
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
another_dict = dict()   


# set 
# => Set (Collection of Items in an unordered sequence ) and it is mutable (Can be changed) and it is unordered (Does not maintain the order of insertion)
# => Set is used to store unique items
# => Set is faster than list
# => Set is used to remove duplicates from a list
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
another_set = set()


# None => NoneType (Represents the absence of a value)
# => None is used to represent the absence of a value

none = None
